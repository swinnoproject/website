# Repo for SWINNO's website

## Usage

The easiest way to update this website is to edit a document directly on github.
Go to the file that you wish to change make your changes and then click on the pen icon and begin editing.
When you are happy with the edit, click on the green button "Commit changes".
You will be prompted to write a commit message, but for simple changes you can accept the default that is already filled in.
Make sure that you commit directly in the main branch (the default option) and click on commit changes once more.
That is it!
A workflow should now be triggered that updates the websites.
It can take a few minutes for your changes to appear and do not forget to refresh the site.
