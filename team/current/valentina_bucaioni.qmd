:::{.text-bigger}

I am a Ph.D. student in Innovation Management at the University of Siena,
where I research collaboration networks between universities and companies in
science and technology in high-tech industries.

I use the SWINNO data to analyze networks of innovations through patents and
products in the Swedish ICT sector.
