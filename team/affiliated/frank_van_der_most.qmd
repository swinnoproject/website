I make databases for sustainability research. Currently, I am doing that at the Economic History Department at Lund University in Sweden, where I have been developing a database for historical data on Swedish innovations. During a 2020 sabbatical in Costa Rica with my partner, we volunteered for Osa Conservation. I have developed a table-stitching database to glue together the different datasheets that they created over time with their sea turtle nesting program. This work made me realize that I want to orient my database developing more towards nature conservation and biological research. To do so, I am starting a company called Rubber Boots Data.
